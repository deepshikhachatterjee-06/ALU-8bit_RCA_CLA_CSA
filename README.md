# ALU-8bit_RCA_CLA_CSA
This project presents the design, simulation, and FPGA implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) integrating three different adder architectures:

Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)

Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)

Carry Select Adder (CSA)

The ALU performs multiple arithmetic and logical operations including addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, comparison (A > B), and pass-through (output A).

The project demonstrates FPGA synthesis and performance analysis using Xilinx Vivado, focusing on LUT utilization and combinational delay.
